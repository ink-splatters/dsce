# dsce

Incomplete macOS 12+ dyld cache extractor. Used by [OCLP](https://github.com/dortania/Opencore-Legacy-Patcher/) to support some legacy GPUs and Wi-Fi hardware. Produces working binaries in many cases, but outputs should be treated with extreme suspicion...

## status

- [x] copy header and load commands
	- [x] allocate space for additional commands
- [x] copy segments/sections, fixing offsets and alignment
	- [x] optionally pad to keep addresses contiguous (produces 2+ GB images)
- [x] generate rebase opcodes
	- [x] by applying cache rebase chain
- [x] generate bind opcodes
	- [x] by scanning rebases for external pointers
		- [x] matching imported dylib exports
		- [x] recursing re-exported dylibs/symbols
	- [x] by restoring uniqued `__got` section (Ventura)
	- [x] using C++ addend hack
	- [ ] from weak/lazy bind info
